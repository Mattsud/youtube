        <h2>Rising...What ?</h2>
        <p>Being a YouTuber is hard, especially when you first start out. You spend hours writing, playing, and editing your videos and for what? You get maybe 100 - 500 views and those mainly come from friends and family members. So even if your video is good, nobody actually sees it. What you need is attention - a place where channels of all sizes can compete with one another.</p>
        <p>Being discovered when you’re first starting out is exceptionally hard. It’s like bringing a knife to a gun fight. To be frank, websites like YouTube don’t give a shit about the little guys. Trending videos are reserved for the YouTube famous and you're basically invisible if you have less than 10,000 subscribers. Then your only real path to success is either going viral or being connected with a network that shares your content. </p>
        <p>RisingTube aims to provide viewers with the best content available on the platform, no matter how many or how few subscribers you may have.</p>

        <h2>People loves surprise</h2>
        <p>Discovering rising talent is almost as hard as going viral. Because of this, RisingTube serves both YouTubers and viewers who are sick of seeing the same content recommendations time and time again.</p> <p>As a viewer, I love discovering fresh talent, new videos, and meaningful stories. I do enjoy the handful of YouTubers I follow but I enjoy a good surprise just as much as anyone else. </p>

        <p>Cheers,<br>
          Mathieu</p>
