        <p>My name is <a href="http://www.mathieu-martinot.com" target="_blank">Mathieu Martinot Dubary</a>, I'm French and I live in Canada. Like many others, I tried using YouTube and I found it impossible to share my content without spamming my friends and/or other channels. I thought I needed a new platform to post my content to in order to get views, which is why I founded this site. </p>
        <p>Thanks to RisingTube, the playing field is now level, so good content gets viewed while bad content gets ignored. Here on RisingTube, it’s necessary to create email-verified accounts before voting on a particular video. Similarly, all videos are reviewed before they’re posted. The goal in doing this is to prevent cheating and give every user the same opportunity to rise up like the stars they are.</p>
        <p>Post your video, get upvotes, and start building your community.</p>
        <p>Cheers,<br>
          Mathieu</p>
